1. [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) - Essential system design terminology and concepts
2. [CAP Theorem](cap-theorem.md) - Understanding consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
3. [Consistency Models](consistency-models.md) - Different levels of consistency in distributed systems
4. [Design Principles](design-principles.md) - Guiding principles for building scalable systems
5. [Trade-offs](tradeoffs.md) - Common trade-offs in system design decisions

## Why Fundamentals Matter

In senior-level interviews, you're expected to:
- Understand the theoretical foundations
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- Apply concepts to real-world scenarios
- Make informed architectural decisions

Start here before diving into specific technologies or system designs.
